optimizations:
* go through TODOs in htmltokenizer
* replace "bag of function pointers" with mixins
* on-demand creation of attribute name atoms (most documents don't even
  need atomMap); use ref array/Option?
* htmltokenizer: do something with copyBuf, it's ugly and probably broken
etc:
* turn test1 into a serializer module
