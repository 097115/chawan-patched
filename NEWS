0.4.0 (?)

* Renamed project
* Re-designed interface: it's now push-based
* We now encode/decode from/to UTF-8
	- actually, encoding accepts WTF-8 too
* Added multibyte tests from https://github.com/hsivonen/encoding_rs
* Fixed lots of bugs in multi-byte encoding:
	- EUC-KR encoding was completely broken (it was using the wrong map)
	- GB18030 encoding was completely broken (it didn't handle ASCII)
	- all 16-bit maps were somewhat broken, as they had no de-duplication
* Various other correctness bugfixes
* Reduced binary size somewhat
