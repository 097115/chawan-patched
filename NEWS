0.14 (2024.02.07)

* The "bag of pointers" interface design has been dropped
* Tag and attribute names are now treated as interned strings (a user-defined
  "Atom" type)
* Support processing of embedded SVG/MathML elements
* Chakasu has been made an optional dependency
* std/streams no longer used by htmlparser; now it supports chunked parsing
  instead
* All tokenizer + tree builder tests passed in html5lib-tests

Rough migration guide from the previous API:

Users of minidom

* nodeType is no longer supported, use the of operator to distinguish
  between node types.
* minidom now only supports UTF-8; if you need support for other
  charsets, use minidom_cs.
* localName is now an MAtom; to get the stringified local name, use
  localNameStr.
* attrs is now a seq of Attribute tuples. Linear search this seq to find
  specific attributes.
* minidom now contains several MAtom fields; to convert these to
  strings, call document.atomToStr(atom).

Users of htmlparser

* The NodeType enum has been removed. Either copy-paste the enum
  definition from a previous version, or (more efficient) use the `of`
  operator to distinguish between types.
* Use of an AtomFactory is now required for consumers of htmlparser. The
  easiest fix is to copy-paste the implementation found in minidom.
* Your DOM builder should be generic over a Handle and an Atom. Example:
  `DOMBuilder[Node, MAtom]`
* You no longer have to copy function pointers into your DOM builder.
* It is recommended to add `include chame/htmlparseriface` to your DOM
  builder module. See the htmlparseriface documentation for details.

Switching to the new interface:

* Add `Impl` to the name of all your procedure implementations.
* If you included chame/htmlparseriface, replace all parameters of your
  procedures containing `DOMBuilder[MyHandle]` with `MyDOMBuilder`.
* setCharacterSet -> setEncodingImpl that takes a string label.
* getLocalNameImpl now must return an Atom. getTagType is no longer used.
* insertBeforeImpl must take an `Option[Handle]`
* addAttrsIfMissingImpl is now mandatory, and must take a `Table[Atom, string]`
* getNamespaceImpl is now mandatory.
* getDocumentImpl must be implemented, and must return the Handle of the
  document.
* tagTypeToAtomImpl, atomToTagTypeImpl, strToAtomImpl must all be implemented.
* createHTMLElementImpl must be implemented, and must return the handle of a new
  `<html>` element.
* createElement -> createElementForTokenImpl, the signature has changed
  significantly. localName is the 2-in-1 replacement for both tagType and
  localName. Also, you probably have to convert attributes from htmlAttrs &
  xmlAttrs to your own internal representation.
* finish is no longer called at the end of parsing. Call it yourself.

Event loop changes:

* parseHTML is now split into three parts: initHTML5Parser, parseChunk, finish.
* If you implement scripting and/or character sets other than UTF-8, see
  doc/manual.md for handling parseChunk's result. Otherwise, it is safe to
  discard it.
* Do not forget to call finish after having parsed the entire document (first
  for the parser, then for your own DOM builder).
